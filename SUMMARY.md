## **🤖 The AI Innovation (Our Unique Feature)**

### **What Makes It Special:**
- **Not Random!** - Uses actual Natural Language Processing
- **Instant Analysis** - Results in < 1 second
- **4-Dimension Scoring:**
  - Clarity (structure, examples, details)
  - Innovation (novelty, creativity)
  - Feasibility (practicality, resources)
  - Impact (community benefit)
- **Actionable Feedback** - Tells students exactly how to improve
- **Automatic Workflow** - Determines if idea goes to leaderboard (≥60 score)

### **How It Works:**
```javascript
1. Tokenize text → Extract words and sentences
2. Keyword Analysis → Match against curated lists
3. Structural Analysis → Check length, examples, numbers
4. Sentiment Analysis → Gauge positivity
5. Weighted Scoring → Combine into final 0-100 score
6. Generate Feedback → Human-readable suggestions
7. Assign Status → DRAFT (<60) or UNDER_REVIEW (≥60)
```
