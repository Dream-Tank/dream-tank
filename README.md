#  Shark Tank Mode

**A Campus Innovation Platform for Student Idea Validation**

Transform your campus into an innovation hub where students pitch ideas, receive peer validation, and get mentor endorsements - all integrated seamlessly with your existing Microsoft ecosystem.

##  Problem Statement

Universities have brilliant students with innovative ideas, but lack a structured platform to:
- Validate ideas through peer feedback
- Connect with mentors for guidance  
- Build community around campus innovation
- Gamify the innovation process to drive engagement

**Shark Tank Mode** solves this by creating a mini "Shark Tank" experience on campus, leveraging Microsoft's existing infrastructure.
